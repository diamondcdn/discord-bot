# DiamondCDN Discord Bot

## üì≤ Installation / Self-hosting
Follow the instructions in Compilation first in-order to generate the binaries and settings to run the bot.

Once you've compiled the bot, you need an 'appsettings.json' file, we've excluded ours as it contains our bot token and other private details, here's a template for one though. Copy the template and create a file called 'appsettings.json' in the folder the bot files are in. Change the bot token in the 'appsettings.json' file to whatever your bot token is.

```js
{
    "Logging": {
        "LogLevel": {
            "Default": "Debug",
            "System": "Information",
            "Microsoft": "Information"
        }
    },
    "Token": "Bot token here",
    "GuildId": 123456789012345678,
    "TestingGuildId": 123456789012345678,
    "SupportRole": "Support",
    "LogFileLocation": "bot.log",
}
```

Then see the section below for compiling the bot
